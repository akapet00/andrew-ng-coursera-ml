# Machine Learning | Coursera

All assignments are written in Python3, Matlab code is not publicly available due to the [Code of Honor](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code).
The idea of these excercises was to implement all basic machine learning concepts from the scratch, so no sklearn ootb solutions were used, except for the [excercise 6 - SVM](https://github.com/antelk/andrew-ng-coursera-ml/blob/master/ex6-support-vector-machines/ex6.ipynb)).
